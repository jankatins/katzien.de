What's the right stack for you & how to set it up when you start with data team & a data warehouse (& data is not your
product)? I wrote down my thoughts about an analytics stack for startups at
the [kreuzwerker company blog](https://medium.com/kreuzwerker-gmbh/analytics-stacks-for-startups-ca5c131e3b29):

* Concentrate on what brings value.
* Use simple (and proven) tech.
* Use SQL.

Using this general advice, I set up a stack which is optimized for fast development cycles and without using up your
precious engineering capacity. From loading data into a data warehouse to pushing out curated datasets to users and
systems where these datasets actually generate value.
